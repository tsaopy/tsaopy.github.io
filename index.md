# Welcome to my custom minimal theme Github pages!

You can find links in the sidebar. 

The 'instructions' link goes to a short messy list of instructions to modify this theme.

The 'example page' link is the example page that comes with default gh pages thems. 

## Additions/changes

* Added examples of building API docs and adding them to Github pages
* Modified the css to be able to fit 80 characters length code in the body of each page, doesn't break
rendering in neither 1080 nor 720 px screens, and works on both Mozilla and Chrome.
* Changed the sidebar link to provide access to the API, the source code on Github, and a DOI link such
as a Zenodo DOI or an article presenting the code.
